      <h1 class="text-primary">Saving the Industry from Its Colapse</h1>
      <p>The video game industry suffered from a big colapse in the 80's. Market was saturated and game companies started entering in bankrupt one by one.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, Nintendo managed to revive the already dying industry with the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), with Super Mario Bros. as the flagship title. Who was the mind behind this game? Shigeru Miyamoto. This is a list of other games he has worked on:</p>

    <p>Super Mario Bros. is a platform video game created by Shigeru Miyamoto and developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System home console. Released as a sequel to the 1983 game Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. was released in Japan and North America in 1985. The player controls Mario and in a two-player game, a second player controls Mario's brother Luigi as he travels through the Mushroom Kingdom in order to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser.</p>
    <p>Super Mario Bros. was critically acclaimed. In 2005, a poll by IGN named the "pioneering" and "highly influential" title as the "greatest game of all time", considering it to have aided in resurrecting the crashed American video game market of the 1980s. In addition to its definitive features, the game has also sold well, and was the best-selling game of all time for a single platform for approximately three decades at over 40 million units, until Nintendo's Wii Sports took that title in the late 2000s.</p>

      <p>The Legend of Zelda is a high-fantasy action-adventure video game series created by Japanese game designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. The series' gameplay incorporates elements of action, adventure and puzzle-solving games.</p>
      <p>The series centers on Link, the playable character and chief protagonist. Link is often given the task of rescuing Princess Zelda and the kingdom of Hyrule from Ganon, who is the principal antagonist of the series; however, other settings and antagonists have appeared in several titles, like Vaati, Malladus or Skull Kid.</p>

    <p>F-Zero is a series of futuristic racing video games originally created by Nintendo EAD with multiple games developed by outside companies. The first game was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990; its success prompted Nintendo to create multiple sequels on subsequent gaming consoles.</p>
    <p>Sadly, the series has been largely dormant since the release of F-Zero Climax exclusively in Japan in 2004. Since then, the series has been represented in other Nintendo media, including in the Super Smash Bros. and Mario Kart series, as well as in titles such as Nintendo Land for the Wii U. In addition, titles from the series have been re-released on the Wii U and New Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console services.</p>
